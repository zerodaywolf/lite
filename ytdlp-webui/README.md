## Configuration

### Download Behavior

Files are downloaded directly to your browser's default download folder. No files are permanently stored on the server - they are processed temporarily and then automatically cleaned up.

### Server Configuration

You can modify the server settings in `app.py`:

- **Host**: Change `host='0.0.0.0'` to `host='127.0.0.1'` for local-only access
- **Port**: Change `port=5000` to your preferred port
- **Debug**: Set `debug=False` for production use

### yt-dlp Options

You can customize yt-dlp behavior by modifying the command-line options in the `download_video()` function in `app.py`.

## API Endpoints

The web UI also provides a REST API:

- `GET /` - Main web interface
- `POST /extract_info` - Extract video information
- `POST /download` - Start video download
- `GET /progress/<download_id>` - Get download progress
- `GET /downloads` - List downloaded files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"yt-dlp command not found"**:
   - Make sure yt-dlp is installed: `pip install yt-dlp`
   - Try updating: `pip install --upgrade yt-dlp`

2. **Download fails with "Unable to extract video info"**:
   - The URL might not be supported
   - yt-dlp might need updating (it's actively maintained)
   - Check if the video is private or restricted

3. **Browser download issues**:
   - Check your browser's download settings
   - Make sure downloads aren't blocked by browser security settings

4. **Slow download speeds**:
   - This depends on your internet connection and the source server
   - Consider selecting a lower quality format

### Updating yt-dlp

yt-dlp is actively maintained and regularly updated to support changes in video sites. Update it regularly:

```bash
pip install --upgrade yt-dlp
```

## Security Considerations

- This application is intended for personal use
- Be careful when exposing it to the internet (consider authentication)
- Only download content you have the right to download
- Respect copyright and terms of service of video platforms
